# Matching Prefixes
## Problem statement
Given a list of string prefixes of variable length, the assignment is to implement a method that takes a string as a parameter
and returns the longest prefix that matches the input string. A prefix matches if the input string starts with that prefix.
The list of prefixes to match should be taken as a configuration by your solution. We’ve provided you with sample data that
you can use.

## Sample Data
The attached file is a list of prefixes, one per line, that can be used to test your implementation. Please use these in your
submission, but keep in mind that your solution should work with any list of prefixes.
Instructions
Your task is to implement a method with the functionality defined above in Golang. It is not sufficient for your soluion to
do a linear scan of the list of prefixes. Feel free to pre-process the list of prefixes as you see fit.
What we hope to see in your submitted assignment is an ability to follow the specification and to solve a problem
efficiently. We value readability and clear style in your code.
Your method should be submitted within a project, not as a single source file. Tests are a great way to show that your
implementation works correctly. You may use a readme or comments to document your approach.
Bonus points if you can additionally demonstrate the use of goroutines in the above problem.
Submission Guidelines
Please submit your assignment via email. Include all relevant files — code, tests, build files, but no binaries — in a
compressed folder. You can use the format <initials>_backend.tgz, as in “jbd_backend.tgz", to name the attachment.t
